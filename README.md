### Examples

![image with use options](/readme/first.png)

- use the modes starting with 2 to infer the image file format, if you only need to convert a specific format use the other modes such as p2w (png to wepb)

### Example to parsing one image from png to webp

```bash
imgtl -m="p2w" /home/user/pictures/img-01.png /home/user/pictures/
```

### Example to parsing images from a folder from any format to webp

```bash
imgtl -m="2webp" /home/user/pictures/ /home/user/pictures/
```

### Example to parsing images from a folder from jpg to png, excluiding rest images formats

```bash
imgtl -m="2png" /home/user/pictures/ /home/user/pictures/pngs
```

### Example to parsing images from a folder from png to webp and usign quality option

```bash
imgtl -m="2webp" -q="50" /home/user/pictures/ . 
```

### Example to parsing images from a folder from jpg and resize 

```bash
imgtl -m="2jpg" -ws="1000" /home/user/pictures/ . 
```
*in this case the output image is 1000x1000 

### Example to parsing images from a folder from jpg and resize and conserve aspect

```bash
imgtl -m="2jpg" -ws="1000" -t /home/user/pictures/ . 
```
*in this case the output image conserve aspect ratio
