- use the modes starting with 2 to infer the image file format, if you only need to convert a specific format use the other modes such as p2w (png to wepb)

### Example to parsing one image from png to webp

```bash
python3 src/app.py -m="p2w" /home/user/pictures/img-01.png /home/user/pictures/
```

### Example to parsing images from a folder from any format to webp

```bash
python3 src/app.py -m="2webp" /home/user/pictures/ /home/user/pictures/
```

### Example to parsing images from a folder from jpg to png, excluiding rest images formats
